WorldState.js - 0.1 - a generator for immutable graphs
===
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SanderSpies/WorldState.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SanderSpies/WorldState.js)

Current version: 0.1

ROUGH EDGES

Introduction
---
This generator turns a JSON object model into an immutable graph.

You can use this immutable graph as input for rendering your interface from the top node, and efficiently decide what
needs to happen or not through strict equal checks.

[TodoList example](https://rawgit.com/SanderSpies/WorldState.js/master/examples/ReactTodoList/index.html)

Features
---
- Immutable
- High performance
- Generated JsDocs for auto-complete support
- Support for complex structures
- Recreating parent objects
- Change by value or reference
- Versioning support
- ReactWorldStateMixin to make implementing WorldState.js with React easy
- Warning: stuff might not work completely as advertised - if you come across anything, please file an issue

Although it's possible to only use the library, I would recommend using the generator for creating wrappers around
the library. This way the cognitive strain of using this library is left to a minimum.

[See Jasmine tests for library / non-wrapper examples](tests/BaseTests.js)

Installation
---
First install WorldState.js globally:
```
npm install -g worldstate
```

Then add it to your project's package.json:
```
{
    "dependencies": {
        "worldstate": "~0.1"
    }
}
```
Note: as I'm still getting everything ready for 0.1, the 0.1 release is not on NPM yet.

Getting started
---
First you need to create a JSON representation of the model. For example:

File: TodoGraph.json
```
{
    "title": "an example",
    "items": [
        {
            id: 1,
            title: "example",
            isComplete: false
        },
        {
            id: 2,
            title: "bla 2",
            isComplete: false
        }
    ]
}
```
[Extra syntax options](JSON_SYNTAX.md)

Next you need to generate the immutable wrappers:
```
worldstate inputdir outputdir
```

Now you can use the immutable graph within your application:
```
/**
 * @type {TodoGraph}
 */
var TodoGraph = require('outputdir/TodoGraph');
```

The {TodoGraph} annotation is added for autocomplete support.

Loading data into the graph (you might want to use [superagent](https://github.com/visionmedia/superagent)):
```
var todoGraph = TodoGraph.newInstance({/*data*/});
```

Getting the first item of an array:
```
console.log('The first item is:', todoGraph.items().at(0).read());
```
If you have performed an action like ``insert``, ``insertMulti``, ``changeValueTo`` or ``changeReferenceTo``, you must
wait until the action has completed:

Warning: when you modify objects outside of WorldState.js, like ``foo.read().title = 'bla'``, you violate the
immutability of the object.

```
// perform action like insert, insertMulti, changeValueTo or changeReferenceTo
todoGraph.afterChange(function() {
    // changes are complete
});
```

Finding an item:
```
console.log('Found item:', todoGraph.items().where({id:2})[0].read());
```

Inserting a value:
```
var todoItem = TodoGraphItem.newInstance({
   id: 3,
   title: 'foo',
   isComplete: true
});
todoGraph.items().insert(todoItem);
```

If a new item is inserted with an id parameter that is already present, it will replace the old item.

You can also insert multiple values by using ``insertMulti``, which accepts an array.

Getting the id generated by WorldState.js:
```
var generatedId = todoGraph.items().at(0).generatedId();
```

Changing a value:
```
todoGraph.items().at(0).changeValueTo({
    id: 3,
    title: 'bla',
    isComplete: true
});
```
All the objects using this reference will get this value.

Changing a reference:
```
var somewhereElseInTheGraph = todoGraph.items.at(0);
todoGraph.items().at(1).changeReferenceTo(somewhereElseInTheGraph.read());
```
Now both items will be changed at the same the time when using changeValueTo :-).

Saving and restoring a version:
```
todoGraph.enableVersioning();
todoGraph.saveVersion('Initial version');
todoGraph.items().at(0).changeValueTo({
    id: 3,
    title: 'bla',
    isComplete: true
});
todoGraph.afterChange(function(){
    var versions = todoGraph.getVersions();
    todoGraph.restoreVersion(versions[0]);
});
```

Removing a part of the graph:
```
todoGraph.items().at(1).remove();
```

Using the ReactWorldStateMixin:
```
var React = require('react');
var ReactWorldStateMixin = require('worldstate/src/Helpers/ReactWorldStateMixin');

var Foo = React.createClass({
  mixins: [ReactWorldStateMixin],
  render: function() {
    return <div>Bar</div>;
  }
});
```
Now if you pass an item from WorldState.js it will be checked using strict equals.
