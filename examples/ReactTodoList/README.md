TodoList written with React.js and WorldState.js
===
As I was lazy, this isn't a proper TodoMVC example. For now it's mostly a demo of what is possible when combining
React.js with WorldState.js.

Features:
- add an item
- remove an item
- remove all
- check all

Make sure WorldState.js is installed globally:
```
npm install -g worldstate
```

Install NPM packages:
```
npm install
```

To (re)create the graph for the todo list:
```
worldstate Graph/input Graph
```

Run grunt:
```
grunt
```

Be in awe.
